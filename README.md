# Design-Pattern- [code reusable, speed up dev process, modification become easier, easy to understand flow of code, less code so easy to maintain]

  A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task. design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving the common object oriented design problems. that means, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.
  It is a description or template for how to solve problem that can be used in many different situations.

Adv of design pattern:
  1. They are reusable in multiple projects.
  2. They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
  3. They capture the software engineering experiences.
  4. They provide transparency to the design of application.
  5. They are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert sofware developers.
  6. Design pattern dont guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.
